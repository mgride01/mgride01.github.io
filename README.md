# mgride01.github.io

Personal webpage for mgride01

Contains brief biography, resume, and introduction page

To be implemented: styling for the resume page, including getting rid of the extra bullet points

I spent about 3 hours on the assignment (thought a bulk of that was becoming familiar with HTML/CSS).

To my knowledge, all of the code is correctly implemented. I did not receive any help on this lab.
